ap-image-fullscreen
===================
_**This plugin and this readme file is still under development.**_

**ap-image-fullscreen** is a jQuery plugin for showing images in fullscreen mode, in combination with zoom functionality (see [ap-image-zoom](https://github.com/armin-pfaeffle/ap-image-zoom) plugin). If there is no fullscreen support you can use *pseudo fullscreen mode*, which only uses the browsers client area size.


# Example
[Basic usage](http://www.armin-pfaeffle.de/labs/ap-image-fullscreen/example.html)

*More complex examples coming soon...*


# Core Features
- Highly customizable plugin for showing images in fullscreen mode, in combination with [ap-image-zoom](https://github.com/armin-pfaeffle/ap-image-zoom) plugin.
- Predefined and completely customizable shortcuts
- Individual background colors via `data-background-color`attribute, e.g. `<img src="..."  data-background-color="#ccf
/>`.
- Lazy loading for minimizing traffic


# Documentation
Coming soon ;)


# API
Coming soon ;)


# TODO
- Individual direction from where the next/previous slides in; perhaps fade effect instead of sliding?
- Add `images` option to settings where user can set list of images which should be used instead of jquery selection
- Add overview bar
- Add information bar
- Add page indicators
- New (better?) download icon
- Individual zoom settings for each page
- Allow adding fullscreen container to an DOM element, so user can wrap the plugin
